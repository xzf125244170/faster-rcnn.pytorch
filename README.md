# A *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN for fruit detection

This project is a pytorch implementation of a faster R-CNN for fruit detection, it's based on implementation of:
* [jwyang/faster_rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster_rcnn_pytorch), developed based on Pytorch + Numpy
## Introduction

This project is a *faster* pytorch implementation of faster R-CNN, aimed to accelerating the training of faster R-CNN object detection models. Recently, there are a number of good implementations:


* [jwyang/faster_rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster_rcnn_pytorch), developed based on Pytorch + Numpy
* [rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn), developed based on Pycaffe + Numpy

* [longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch), developed based on Pytorch + Numpy

* [endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn), developed based on TensorFlow + Numpy

* [ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn), developed based on Pytorch + TensorFlow + Numpy

During our implementing, we referred the above implementations, especailly [longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch). However, our implementation has several unique and new features compared with the above implementations:

* **It is pure Pytorch code**. We convert all the numpy implementations to pytorch!

* **It supports multi-image batch training**. We revise all the layers, including dataloader, rpn, roi-pooling, etc., to support multiple images in each minibatch.

* **It supports multiple GPUs training**. We use a multiple GPU wrapper (nn.DataParallel here) to make it flexible to use one or more GPUs, as a merit of the above two features.

* **It supports three pooling methods**. We integrate three pooling methods: roi pooing, roi align and roi crop. More importantly, we modify all of them to support multi-image batch training.

* **It is memory efficient**. We limit the image aspect ratio, and group images with similar aspect ratios into a minibatch. As such, we can train resnet101 and VGG16 with batchsize = 4 (4 images) on a sigle Titan X (12 GB). When training with 8 GPU, the maximum batchsize for each GPU is 3 (Res101), totally 24.

* **It is faster**. Based on the above modifications, the training is much faster. We report the training speed on NVIDIA TITAN Xp in the tables below.


## Benchmarking

We benchmark our code thoroughly on three datasets: pascal voc, coco and imagenet-200, using two different network architecture: vgg16 and resnet101. Below are the results:

**Note**: This pretrained model is a pretrained faster_rcnn network, not just an vgg16 as below in pretrained models section
### What we are going to do

- [x] Support both python2 and python3 (great thanks to [cclauss](https://github.com/cclauss)).
- [ ] Add deformable pooling layer as an alternative way for roi pooling (mainly supported by [Xander](https://github.com/xanderchf))
- [ ] ~~Run systematical experiments on PASCAL VOC 07/12, COCO, ImageNet, Visual Genome (VG) with different settings.~~
- [ ] ~~Write a detailed report about the new stuffs in our implementations, and the quantitative results in our experiments.~~

## Preparation 


First of all, clone the code
```
git clone https://github.com/imatge-upc/faster-rcnn.pytorch.git
```

Then, create a folder:
```
cd faster-rcnn.pytorch && mkdir data
```
**NOTE:** You better crate the data dir on /work/user/ directory for space reasons

In the data folder is where datasets and models must be stored

### prerequisites

* Python 2.7
* Pytorch 0.2.0
* CUDA 8.0 or higher

### Data Preparation

* **PASCAL_VOC 07+12**: Please follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare VOC datasets. Actually, you can refer to any others. After downloading the data, creat softlinks in the folder data/.

* **COCO**: Please also follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare the data.

* **Visual Genome**: Please follow the instructions in [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) to prepare Visual Genome dataset. You need to download the images and object annotation files first, and then perform proprecessing to obtain the vocabulary and cleansed annotations based on the scripts provided in this repository.

* **Underwood_dataset**: 
If annotations are in bounding circles, there's is necessary to execute square_annot.py script that annotates in square bounding boxes and in a similiar format that VOC annotations. See the dataset structure [here](http://data.acfr.usyd.edu.au/ag/treecrops/2016-multifruit/)

### Pretrained Model

We used two pretrained models in our experiments, VGG and ResNet101. You can download these two models from:

* VGG16: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3brpk0bdq60nyb/vgg16_caffe.pth?dl=0), [VT Server](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/vgg16_caffe.pth)

* ResNet101: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iev3tkbz5wyyuz9/resnet101_caffe.pth?dl=0), [VT Server](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jw2yang/faster-rcnn/pretrained-base-models/resnet101_caffe.pth)

Download them and put them into the data/pretrained_model/.

**NOTE**. We compare the pretrained models from Pytorch and Caffe, and surprisingly find Caffe pretrained models have slightly better performance than Pytorch pretrained. We would suggest to use Caffe pretrained models from the above link to reproduce our results. 

**NOTE**. That is not a faster-rcnn pretrained model, is just a pretrained VGG16 model to start to train "from scratch" the faster_rcnn part

**If you want to use pytorch pre-trained models, please remember to transpose images from BGR to RGB, and also use the same data transformer (minus mean and normalize) as used in pretrained model.**

### Compilation

As pointed out by [ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn), choose the right `-arch` in `lib/make.sh` file, to compile the cuda code:

  | GPU model  | Architecture |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | TitanX (Maxwell/Pascal) | sm_52 |
  | GTX 960M | sm_50 |
  | GTX 1080 (Ti) | sm_61 |
  | Grid K520 (AWS g2.2xlarge) | sm_30 |
  | Tesla K80 (AWS p2.xlarge) | sm_37 |
  
More details about setting the architecture can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) or [here](http://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/)

For selecting the gpu architecture there are examples in makesh_examples/ so copy that as lib/make.sh

Information of the GPUs architecture of the imatge server is at:
[imatge.upc.edu information](https://imatge.upc.edu/trac/wiki/DevelopmentPlatform/HardwareResources)

Install all the python dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile the cuda dependencies using following simple commands:

```
cd lib
srun --gres=gpu:pascal:1,gmem:6G --mem 12G sh make.sh
or
srun --gres=gpu:maxwell:1,gmem:6G --mem 12G sh make.sh

```

It will compile all the modules you need, including NMS, ROI_Pooing, ROI_Align and ROI_Crop. The default version is compiled with Python 2.7, please compile by yourself if you are using a different python version.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** The srun --gres... until python script execution has to be the same of what used in compilation of make.sh

## Train/val

Before training set the directories where to load the pretrained VGG16 model (args.load_dir) and where to save the trained faster-rcnn model(args.save_dir)

There are two ways of do the training and the validation steps:

**First way: Train and validation separately**

Train first executing the train_net.py and then run the val_net.py and select for the val_net.py where to load the trained faster-rcnn model. 

To execute the train:

```
srun --gres:$architecture:1,gmem:6G --mem 30G -c 2 python train_net.py \
              --dataset underwood --net vgg16 \
              --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \
              --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \
              --cuda
```
example:
```
srun --gres:$architecture:1,gmem:6G --mem 30G -c 2 python train_net.py \
              --dataset underwood --net vgg16 \
              --bs 4 --nw 2 \
              --lr 1e-3 --lr_decay_step 1 \
              --cuda
```
**Note** The train_net.py will load vgg16 pretrained model, not faster_rcnn model

To execute the validation:
```
srun --gres:$architecture:1,gmem:6G --mem 30G -c 2 python val_net.py --dataset underwood --net vgg16 --cuda
```
**Note** Thre val_net.py will load faster_rcnn trained model
**Second way: Train and validation jointly in the same script**

Execute trainval to do the train and validation in the same script
```
srun --gres:$architecture:1,gmem:6G --mem 30G -c 2 python trainval_net.py \
              --dataset underwood --net vgg16 \
              --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \
              --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \
              --cuda
```

These scripts only compute the loss

## Test

If you want to evlauate the detection performance of a pre-trained faster-rcnn model on underwood test set, simply run
```
srun --gres:$architecture:1,gmem:6G --mem 30G python test_net.py --dataset underwood --net vgg16 \
                   --cuda
```
This script only computes mean average precision

You can manually modify the set to load (if test or validation) writing args.imdbvalnames or args.imdbtestnames on the call of combined_roidb(___)


## Demo

If you want to run detection on your own images with a pre-trained model, download the pretrained model listed in above tables or train your own models at first, then add images to folder $ROOT/images, and then run
```
python demo.py --net vgg16 \
               --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \
               --cuda --load_dir path/to/model/directoy
```

Then you will find the detection results in folder $ROOT/images. 

**Note the default demo.py merely support pascal_voc categories. You need to change the [line](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/blob/530f3fdccaa60d05fa068bc2148695211586bd88/demo.py#L156) to adapt your own model.**

Below are some detection results:
